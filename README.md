# :clapper: sentiment-analysis

This is a university lab work for my Advanced Machine Learning course.

The goal is to classify movie reviews as overall positive or negative. A canvas was provided by the professor. We had to fill it in order to train a neural network and fine-tune GloVe embeddings for the task. 

I submitted this work in October 2022.
